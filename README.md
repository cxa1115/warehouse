# warehouse

First time to build a respository on GitHub, it feels nice to be here.



And this \warehouse is a real warehouse for me :), cuz I have just began to learn some PHP thanks to the inspiration from one of my best bruddi Waldemar.



Now I have only learned some basis and I will keep learn more and practice more. I will wirte somthing down when I do something new.



We'll see on GitHub !!!



(July 24 2017) I push a html data with some css and div to my respository, because I have learned some basic knowledge for html. Besides I have to learn them for my PHP. Keep learning step by step.


(July 25 2017) I learned some JavaScript stuff with a App called MaJi, it works good for me. I just followed the first two lessons, successfully a button reaction to change content in any tag with JS function, get the current date. Steped in PHP let me know that more and more things are waiting for me to learn. And like I said, say thank you to my friend Wowa, and KEEP DOING IT.
